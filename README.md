# heatbed

This is a heatbed for my Printrbot LC printer. I've expanded the Y axis almost double what it was before. The new dimensions of the printable area are 150 x 285 x 135 mm. This heatbed PCB is the full size of the print platform, not just the printable area. The reason for this is to help leveling the bed when I add the glass top.
